    "# Feature Selection Mini-project\n",
    "\n",
    "Katie explained in a video a problem that arose in preparing Chris and Sara’s email for the author identification project; it had to do with a feature that was a little too powerful (effectively acting like a signature, which gives an arguably unfair advantage to an algorithm). You’ll work through that discovery process here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "This bug was found when Katie was trying to make an overfit decision tree to use as an example in the decision tree mini-project. A decision tree is classically an algorithm that can be easy to overfit; one of the easiest ways to get an overfit decision tree is to use a small training set and lots of features.\n",
    "If a decision tree is overfit, would you expect the accuracy on a test set to be very high or pretty low?\n",
    "\n",
    "- low\n",
    "\n",
    "If a decision tree is overfit, would you expect high or low accuracy on the training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "- high accuracy on training set if overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of Features and Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic way to overfit an algorithm is by using lots of features and not a lot of training data. You can find the starter code in feature_selection/find_signature.py. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/mudspringhiker/ud120-projects/blob/master/feature_selection/find_signature.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Get a decision tree up and training on the training data, and print out the accuracy. How many training points are there, according to the starter code?"

action is as a brief descript of the margaux transact in case you have not been updat recent the margaux transact will now occur through the synthet transfer of risk to the noteholdersmargaux equiti the method by which this occur is as follow whitew continu to hold the equiti interest in the asset exclud 56 of trakya etol approx 3125 of sutton bridg 50 of nowa sarzyna and approx 50 of teessid all of which are held by enron whitew enter into a fix for float swap with ena with whitew make a fix annual payment to ena in an amount repres the base case cash flow of the under asset and ena make a float payment to whitew that is initi equal to the fix payment from whitew but is adjust downward if certain identifi negat thing happen at the various project therebi transfer certain of the risk of the project through the float leg concurr margaux the issuer rais approx 511 mm of capit and through a wholllyown subsidiari purchas the float leg receiv from whitew for 511 mm in other word whitew enter into the swap and immedi monet it receiv to margaux the net result is that whitew receiv cash proceed up front and has a fix payment oblig to ena and ena has a float payment oblig to margaux ive attach a structur diagram below with this in mind the follow issu relat to whitew have arisen the tax group would like to character the payment ena receiv from whitew as a prefer partnership distribut see attach note from donett dewar below my question is how do we achiev this result first is whitew lp abl to enter into this transact itself or doe it need to occur at a subsidiari level in other word doe the swap fall under the definit of indebted claus viii perhap in the whitew lp agreement which is prohibit at the whitew level if it cannot is se acquisit the best candid to be ena counterparti or do we run into issu with the natwest facil although theyd like consent sinc they will get repaid out of the proceed of the transact onc the issu of who is the appropri counterparti has been determin we need to discuss the mechan by which we effect the transact if we are inde go to open up the whitew lp agreement i suspect that annmari will need to revisit the alloc and distribut section which is probabl no easi task if not and the transact will occur at a subsidiari level we need to determin where also im sure this transact will requir certificatehold approv as it is in excess of the 40mm threshold a final logist issu that donett rais in her note is who will be respons for the legal work requir at the whitew level more general are there ani other legal or other issu

lower of those two howev if the post collater is a letter of credit then a parti should be entitl to hold the letter of credit regardless of their credit rate under the term of gi the parti and it custodian are individu entitl to hold post collater howev there are no requir for a custodian i believ the requir of a qualifi institut should appli to the custodian if there is a rate requir for the parti in order for it to hold post collater and the parti is no longer in complianc with that rate requir then in order to compli with the general term of the csa the parti would have to transfer the post collater to a custodian which met the requir of a custodian or els it would be in breach of the agreement which would be an event of default if not remedi within 30 day therefor if you appli the requir of a qualifi institut to a custodian under gi then gii2 and 3 can be remov final we would like the requir of the custodian to be a rate of at least aa2 and have total asset of at least us

collater is move to a custodian there is no reason whi the pledgor who was not downgrad should be penal by not receiv interest payment in the form of cash when they are paid on the post collater as a matter of fact it is my understand that it is more difficult oper to reinvest such fund and much easier to pay them to the pledgor csa m other provis the definit of feder fund effect rate is not
